### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to format the layout of a web page.

## With CSS you can do the following:

#### 1.Control color, font, and text size
#### 2.How to place and lay out items 
#### 3.Background images or background colors to be used


## There are some ways to add CSS, including:
### Inline CSS Style
#### Inline styles are used to apply unique style rules to an element by placing CSS rules directly at the start tag. It can be attached to an element using the style attribute.

## Embedded style sheets
#### 1.Embedded or internal style sheets affect only the document they are embedded in.
#### 2.Style sheets embedded in the <head> section of an HTML document are defined using the <style> element.

## exterior style sheets
#### 1.An external style sheet is ideal when applying the style to many pages of a website. 
#### 2.All the style rules are in a separate document that you can link from any HTML file on your site



## The color CSS property sets the foreground color value for element text and body decorations It specifies the value of <currentcolor>. currentcolor can be used as an indirect value on other properties and is the default for other color properties.
