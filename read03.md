# HTML : HyperText Markup Language.
### HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create and design web pages and websites, and this language is considered one of the oldest and most widely used languages ​​in web page design. HTML Structure of a web page Gives the Internet browser a description of how it displays its contents Techniques such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages ​​such as JavaScript Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or file system and display them, and the function of HTML is to describe the structure of pages The web is structural.

### Elements in HTML are the basic building blocks of HTML documents, with which we can add images and interactive objects such as forms or video and audio files; You can also create structured documents by using tags to denote paragraphs, headings, links, quotes, tables, and more.

### HTML can include programs written in languages ​​such as JavaScript to modify the behavior and content of web pages; Adding CSS code defines the look and layout of the content.




# Semantics

### In programming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages.[1] It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.



# Wireframe and Design 

### It is a visual guide that shows the frame or the structural form of any website and determines the design of the page or the way the contents are organized, including interface elements, browsing systems, and how to integrate them. Usually, the frame does not have a typographical style, color, or graphics, as the focus is on effectiveness, behavior, and priority. Content The page layout focuses on the type of information displayed, the range of functions available, the relative priorities of information and functionality, the rules used in presenting certain types of information, and the design of communications.
