## What is JavaScript?

 ### is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation, and first-class functions.

### Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use their client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

### As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).


### JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.


# variables

### A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.

### There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).

### 1. Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.

### 2. After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.

### 3. JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
