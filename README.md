### Growth Mindset

#### While I passed high school and did not complete the stages of success, I was disappointed and began to think with a fixed mindset, which is the exact opposite of the growth mentality, due to frustration and laziness, and it leads to a lot of wasting time and effort on things that have no value or use in life.

#### The best solution to this situation was to gradually change the way of thinking until I reach a growth mindset, But it is not easy to change the way of thinking about life, this stage requires a lot of effort and perseverance.

#### One of the best ways to change the way of thinking is:

* To be positive.
* rational in thinking.
* hard work.
* changing the daily routine by increasing the number of activities.

#### through these steps By studying the specialization I want, this is the benefit of the growth mentality for me. Thank you
